"""A setup script for APEL SSM.

This script installs the APEL SSM library, sender and reciever. This
should be similar to installing the RPM apel-ssm, although there
may be some differences.

Known differences are:
- the RPM installs pyc and pyo files, whereas this script does not.
- this script will not install system specific init style files.

Usage: 'python setup.py install'

Requires setuptools.
